Whilst many video players support external subtitle files, embedding them directly into the video offers several advantages, namely:

* **Platform Compatibility:** Ensures subtitles display on platforms with limited or no external subtitle support.
* **Simplified Distribution:** Allows distribution of a single video file without requiring separate subtitle files.
* **Accessibility:** Provides always-on captions for users who need them.

This repository details how to use a single FFmpeg command to permanently embed (burn in) subtitles from a separate captions file into an MP4 video. This process integrates the subtitles directly into the video stream, ensuring they are always visible across various playback environments.

At its heart, the flow would be:

The fundamental command for burning in subtitles is:

~~~```json
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf subtitles=captions.srt output.mp4
~~~


*`ffmpeg`: Invokes the FFmpeg tool.

*`-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file. Replace input.mp4 with the actual path to your video file.

*`-vf subtitles=captions.srt`: Applies the subtitles video filter.

*`subtitles`: The FFmpeg filter responsible for rendering subtitles onto video frames.

*`captions.srt`: The path to your subtitle file. FFmpeg commonly supports formats like SRT (.srt) or WebVTT (.vtt). Replace captions.srt with the correct path to your subtitle file.

*`output.mp4`: Specifies the output video file with the burned-in subtitles. Choose your desired filename.


The command executes the following steps:

* Decode: FFmpeg reads and decodes the input video stream (`input.mp4`).

* Apply Filter: The subtitles filter reads the text and timing information from the `captions.srt` file.

* Render: The subtitle text is drawn onto each video frame according to the timing data.

* Encode: The modified video frames (with embedded subtitles) are encoded into a new MP4 video file (`output.mp4`).

**Important Considerations**

* Subtitle Format: Ensure your subtitle file is in a format FFmpeg can process (SRT is highly recommended for simplicity).

* File Paths: Double-check that the paths to your input video and subtitle files are accurate.

* Re-encoding: Burning in subtitles necessitates re-encoding the video, which can take time depending on the video's size and your system's resources.

* Quality: Whilst FFmpeg's default settings are generally good, re-encoding might slightly reduce video quality. For more control, explore FFmpeg's encoding options (e.g., `-crf` for H.264/H.265).

* Styling: Basic styling (like bold and italics in SRT) might be rendered. 

**Example**

Assuming you have a video file named my_video.mp4 and a subtitle file named `english_subs.srt` in the same directory, the command would be:

Bash

~~~```json
ffmpeg -i my_video.mp4 -vf subtitles=english_subs.srt output_with_subs.mp4
~~~

This will generate a new file named output_with_subs.mp4 with the subtitles permanently embedded.
